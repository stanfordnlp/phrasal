Equivalence on French/English Task
-----------------------------------

Result Date: 6/25/2007

Data Set: French/English dev set from shared task for ACL 2005 - Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts
Details: 2000 French sentences, each with 1 English reference translation

Training: 

8 iterations of MERT using the first 1000 sentences in the dev set.

Decoding Details:

Stack Size: 200
Translation Table Limit: 20
Beam Threshold: 0
Unlimited Distortion: (-dl -1)

Results:

           multi-bleu.pl
Phrasal    30.25, 64.1/36.2/23.2/15.5 (BP=1.000, ration=1.000) 
Moses      30.25, 64.1/36.2/23.2/15.5 (BP=1.000, ration=1.000)

Phrasal/Moses translations pairs with matching model scores: 100% (2000/2000)
(./compare_scores.pl dev_all.phrasal.mert1000.log dev_all.moses.mert1000.log)

Phrasal/Moses translations pairs with matching surface forms: 99.9% (1998/2000)
(./diff_with_stats.pl dev_all.phrasal.mert1000.trans dev_all.moses.mert1000.trans)

Analysis:

For both instances were the translations generated by Moses and Phrasal differ, the translations are almost 
identical but only differ in that the order of two words are swapped. Specifically, for one pair we have 
"annihilated **600** **notable** deportees" vs. "annihilated **notable** **600** deportees", while for the 
other we have "27 **already** **obsolescent** way" vs. "27 **obsolescent** **already**". For both instances, 
due to back-off, the language model does not distinguish between the two alternative orderings. Further, the 
arrangement of the original words in the French sentences allows the alternative orderings to produce the same
aggregate linear distortion score.

Conclusion: 

Given a model and a foreign sentence, Phrasal is as effective as Moses in performing inference over the space of possible translations.

Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family.
At first, the emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage.
The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag).
The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.
These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.
With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.
A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech.
The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases.
Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.
There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.
Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,as are symptoms of paranoia; social isolation commonly occurs.
In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.
In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself before the age of 19.
The physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in The Nature of the Physical World (1928), writing: If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence.
If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum.
The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.
These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.
Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.
The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was a multi-sport event celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.
It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era.
Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games.
Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success.
The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date.
The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.
The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis.
The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.

The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.
Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family.
At first, the emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage.
The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag).
The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.
These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.
With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.
A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech.
The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases.
Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.
There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.
Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,as are symptoms of paranoia; social isolation commonly occurs.
In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.
In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself before the age of 19.
The physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in The Nature of the Physical World (1928), writing: If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence.
If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum.
The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.
These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.
Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.
The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was a multi-sport event celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.
It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era.
Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games.
Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success.
The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date.
The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.
The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis.

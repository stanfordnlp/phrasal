<h1>Overview of the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java</h1>
<p>
  The Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java is a set of libraries and tools designed to make it easier for you to build solutions leveraging Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The goals of the SDK are:
  <ul>
    <li>To abstract you from the "muck" of using web services</li>
    <li>To simplify using the various Amazon Mechanical Turk APIs</li>
    <li>To allow you to focus more on solving the business problem and less on managing technical details</li>
  </ul>
</p>

Before getting started, you should first review the getting started and developer guides for the Amazon Mechanical Turk web service APIs <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/mturk/">here</a>.  They provide excellent background information on the various concepts of Amazon Mechanical Turk.

<h2>Logging and Debugging</h2>
The SDK for Java uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html" target="_blank">Log4J</a> for logging.  View the <strong>log4j.properties</strong> file that is used for the sample applications as an example of a logging configuration.  This file can be found here:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\etc\log4j.properties
</span>

The level of logging can be specified in the <strong>mturk.properties</strong> file.  To set the level of logging:
<ol>
  <li>Open your <strong>mturk.properties</strong> in a text editor.</li>
  <li>Add the following line as a property in the file:<br/>
  <span class="programlisting">log_level=[your desired log level]</span></li>
  <li>Save and close the file.</li>
</ol>

For more information on the logging levels and what details are logged for each level, access the Log4J documentation on <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/index.html" target="_blank">log levels</a>.

<a name="developingwithsdk"/>
<h2>Development Resources Included in the SDK</h2>
The SDK includes the precompiled libraries, documentation in the form of Javadoc, and the source code.
<h3>Location of JARs</h3>
All required libraries have been precompiled and included in the distribution.  Include in your development classpath all the JARs in the following directories:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\lib<br/>
[SDK Installation Directory]\lib\third-party<br/>
</span>
<h3>Location of Javadoc</h3>
The Javadoc can be found in the following location:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\doc
</span>
<h3>Location of SDK source code</h3>
All the source code used to generate the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java has been provided for reference.  It can be found in the following location:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\src
</span>

<h3>Location of SDK test source code</h3>
All the source code used to test the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java has been provided for reference.  It can be found in the following location:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\test
</span>

<p>
To build the unit tests you're required to have a compatible version of the junit package.   

<ol>
  <li>Download a copy of junit at <a href="http://www.junit.org/" target="_blank">www.junit.org</a>.</li>
  <li>Extract the downloaded junit directory under the third-party directory.  Follow the naming convention of junit-[version]. 
  <span class="programlisting">
    [SDK Installation Directory]\lib\third-party\junit-4.4
  </span>
</li>
  <li>Compile and run the unit tests:
<span class="programlisting">
[SDK Installation Directory]\ant run-test
</span>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="portability"/>
<h2>Portability of convenience files</h2>
In general, the convenience files (i.e. mturk.properties, input files, question template, HIT template, etc.) used by the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java are portable to the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools.<p/>
However, the convenience files are not currently portable to other Amazon Mechanical Turk SDKs in other programming languages (i.e. Ruby, C#, PERL, etc.).<p/>
Portability across SDKs on different programming platforms is a desired goal for future releases.

Directories:

scripts/
	scripts to extract data from LDC releases and build LMs

input/
	tokenized and untokenized input

train/
	sorted n-gram counts

releases/
	ARPA LMs

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to build large LMs:

1) Log into a 16gb machine, e.g. jen. Move this checked out directory to its local disk 
   (e.g., /jen/scr1/ IF you are on jen). Make sure you have enough disk space (>= 30gb).
2) run scripts/init.sh 
   (this also deletes all .svn directories, in order to avoid any accidental svn commit).
3) Modify scripts/LDC*.sh to filter out epoch of tune/test data.
5) Modify input/Makefile.local to point to the MT parallel data and
   to the correct LM tokenization script (i.e., make sure that the 
	 target side of MT data and LM data have same tokenization).
6) cd train
7) run "../scripts/mt_g3_afp_xin_1233 -n"; it should produce the same
   output as in Appendix A (see blow).
8) run "../scripts/mt_g3_afp_xin_1233"; this may take 1-2 days to 
   build a LM. Rebuilding may take as little as 3-4 hours (see notes below how to do this).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important notes:
- If you need to RE-train a LM, you may need to manually delete some temporary files.
 * if you changed anything in scripts/LDC*sh (e.g., filtered out Gigaword3 by epoch)
	 or in input/Makefile*, you need to manually delete all intermediate files: 
	 input/*.gz, train/*.gz train/counts
 * if you increased, removed, or altered LM sources, e.g., modified ../scripts/mt_g3_afp_xin_1233 
   to also include NYT data, you need to delete merged counts (train/counts). Alternatively, 
	 copy mt_g3_afp_xin_1233 to a new file name and change its setting of LMID.
 * if you just changed ngram count cutoffs, e.g., set "-gt5min 2" instead of "-gt5min 3"
   you don't need to delete any file
   (look at ../scripts/mt_g3_afp_xin_1233 to see how these cutoffs are specified)
- If you set -gt4min and/or -gt5min to 2, you need a 48gb machine. You only need 
  that much memory during the very last step of LM construction, so *please* do the following:
	1) First use a 16gb machine to generate a LM with higher ngram count thresholds, e.g.: 
	  $ ../scripts/mt_g3_afp_xin_1233
    This will take 1-2 days, unless you already generated some intermediate files.
	2) Log into a 48gb machine, and rerun the last command executed by the above script 
	  (it should be "make-big-lm" followed by some arguments), but this time with lower thresholds, 
		e.g., change:
		make-big-lm [...] -gt4min 3 -gt5min 3 -lm ../releases/mt_giga3_afp_xin.1233.unk.lm.gz
		into
    make-big-lm [...] -gt4min 2 -gt5min 2 -lm ../releases/mt_giga3_afp_xin.1222.unk.lm.gz
		Note that the -lm option should also change if you don't want to overwrite the older ARPA file.
		Step 2 should take 3-6 hours.

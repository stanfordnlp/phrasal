## Installation

We use [Gradle](http://gradle.org) to build Phrasal. It is installed via
the gradle wrapper.  You can run `./gradlew` and the wrapper
will install the correct version.

## Deploying to Nexus

* Configure your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` to include these fields:

```
nexusUrl=https://nexus-jx.lilt.com
nexusUsername=[username]
nexusPassword=[password]
```
* Bump the `version` number in `build.gradle`
* Run `./gradlew build uploadArchives`.  The artifact will be uploaded as `phrasal` inside the
  group `com.lilt`, with the specified version.

### Linux / Mac OS X

These instructions assume you are using the `bash` shell, which is
usually the default shell.

1. Switch to the root of the Phrasal repository and execute: `gradle installDist`

1. Set PHRASAL_HOME: ``export PHRASAL_HOME=`pwd` ``

1. Set CLASSPATH: `export CLASSPATH=$PHRASAL_HOME/build/install/phrasal/lib/*`

1. (Optional) Build Eclipse project files by executing: `gradle eclipse`.

1. (Optional, requires g++, [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)) Build the KenLM loader: `gradle compileKenLM`.

1. (Optional, requires g++, JDK, and Boost) Build the KenLM language model estimation tools: `gradle compileKenLMtools`.

### Windows

Follow the Linux instructions above. Then be sure to execute `gradle startupScripts` to generate a .bat file.

## Documentation / User Guide

See [the user guide](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/wiki/Software/Phrasal) for complete installation and configuration instructions. The guide also contains a tutorial for building an MT system from raw text.

## Support

We have 3 mailing lists for Phrasal, all of which are shared with other Stanford JavaNLP
tools (with the exclusion of the parser). 

Each address is at @lists.stanford.edu:

*java-nlp-user* -- This is the best list to post to in order to ask questions, make
announcements, or for discussion among JavaNLP users. You have to subscribe to 
be able to use it. Join the list via this webpage or by emailing 
java-nlp-user-join@lists.stanford.edu. (Leave the subject and message body 
empty.) You can also look at the list archives.

*java-nlp-announce* -- This list will be used only to announce new versions of 
Stanford JavaNLP tools. So it will be very low volume (expect 1-3 message a 
year). Join the list via via this webpage or by emailing 
java-nlp-announce-join@lists.stanford.edu. (Leave the subject and message 
body empty.)

*java-nlp-support* -- This list goes only to the software maintainers. It's a good 
address for licensing questions, etc. For general use and support questions, 
please join and use java-nlp-user. You cannot join java-nlp-support, but you 
can mail questions to java-nlp-support@lists.stanford.edu.
